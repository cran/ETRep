Description: Analysis of elliptical tubes with applications in biological modeling. The package is based on the references: Taheri, M., Pizer, S. M., & Schulz, J. (2024) "The Mean Shape under the Relative Curvature Condition." arXiv <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2404.01043>. Mohsen Taheri Shalmani (2024) "Shape Statistics via Skeletal Structures", PhD Thesis, University of Stavanger, Norway <doi:10.13140/RG.2.2.34500.23685>. Key features include constructing discrete elliptical tubes, calculating transformations, validating structures under the Relative Curvature Condition (RCC), computing means, and generating simulations. Supports intrinsic and non-intrinsic mean calculations and transformations, size estimation, plotting, and random sample generation based on a reference tube. The intrinsic approach relies on the interior path of the original non-convex space, incorporating the RCC, while the non-intrinsic approach uses a basic robotic arm transformation that disregards the RCC.
